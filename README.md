## Smartphone Price Prediction Project

ðŸ“Œ This project implements a machine learning model to predict the price of smartphones based on their specifications. It utilizes a dataset containing various smartphone features such as brand, processor, RAM, ROM, battery, camera specifications, display size, resolution, and operating system.

### Features

- Preprocessed dataset with cleaned and standardized features.
- Utilizes scikit-learn library for model building.
- Implements a RandomForestRegressor for price prediction.
- Streamlit app for interactive user input and real-time price prediction.
- Evaluates the model using R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8.8
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- streamlit

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Input smartphone specifications, and click the "Predict Price" button to get the predicted price.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided in csv format named "Smartphone_price_dataset.csv"
